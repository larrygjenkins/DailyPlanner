## Description
The goal of this project was to create a simple calendar application that displayed the current date and allowed users to enter tasks and/or events for the hours between 9AM and 5PM. Hours of the day would be color-coded based on whether they were in the past, present, or future, and events recorded by the user were added to (and retrieved from) local storage.
