## Description
The goal of this project was to create a simple calendar application that displayed the current date and allowed users to enter tasks and/or events for the hours between 9AM and 5PM. Hours of the day would be color-coded based on whether they were in the past, present, or future, and events recorded by the user were added to (and retrieved from) local storage.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The current day and date display at the top of the application. 
2. Time blocks for the hours of 9AM to 5PM display and are color-coded based on whether they are in the past, present, or future.
3. Users may enter text into each time block to record events and/or tasks. 
4. When users select the save button for a time block, their events/tasks are saved to local storage.
5. When users refresh the application, their saved tasks are retreived from local storage and are displayed within the appropriate time blocks.
